# ScriptableRenderPipeline
Unity ScriptableRenderPipeline Exploration

I wanted to build an SRP from scratch that targets hardware capable of running Mobile VR (e.g. Google Pixel). This is largely unfinished at this time, but does support a number of features such as Mixed Lighting, Radiosity Normal Mapping with support for up-to 8 dynamic pixel lights, up-to 4 dynamic Shadow Maps from a single shadow-casting light, and a basic transparent queue with per-Material Z-Prime Pass.

I will continue to update this and will continue to post notes as I make progress. This project will remain free for you to use under the MIT License.
